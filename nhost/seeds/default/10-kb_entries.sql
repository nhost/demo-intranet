## Code Review Principles
### Quality Standards
- Code should be readable and maintainable
- Follow established coding standards and conventions
- Include appropriate tests and documentation
- Consider performance and security implications

### Review Process
1. **Before Submitting**

   - Request specific reviewers when appropriate

3. **Reviewing Code**
   - Review within 24 hours when possible
   - Focus on logic, design, and potential issues
   - Provide constructive feedback
   - Approve when code meets standards

## Deployment Pipeline
### Environments
1. **Development**: Feature development and initial testing
2. **Staging**: Pre-production testing and validation
3. **Production**: Live environment serving customers

### Deployment Process
1. **Code Review & Approval**
   - All code must be reviewed and approved
   - CI/CD pipeline must pass all tests
   - Security scans must complete successfully

2. **Staging Deployment**
   - Deploy to staging environment
   - Run automated test suites
   - Perform manual testing of critical paths
   - Stakeholder approval for production deployment

3. **Production Deployment**
   - Schedule deployment during maintenance window
   - Notify team of deployment start
   - Monitor application health during deployment
   - Verify successful deployment

## Pre-Deployment Checklist
### Technical Requirements
- [ ] All tests passing
- [ ] Database migrations tested
- [ ] Configuration changes documented
- [ ] Performance impact assessed
- [ ] Security review completed

### Communication
- [ ] Deployment scheduled and communicated
- [ ] Stakeholders notified
- [ ] Support team briefed on changes
- [ ] Rollback plan prepared

## Monitoring & Verification
### Health Checks
- Application response times
- Database connection status
- Third-party service availability
- Error rates and logs

### Key Metrics
- User login success rates
- API response times
- Database query performance
- Memory and CPU usage

## Rollback Procedures
### When to Rollback
- Critical functionality is broken
- Error rates exceed acceptable thresholds
- Performance degrades significantly
- Security vulnerabilities discovered

### Rollback Steps
1. Stop current deployment
2. Revert to previous application version
3. Rollback database migrations if necessary
4. Clear application caches
5. Verify system functionality
6. Communicate rollback completion

## Emergency Procedures
### Incident Response
1. Assess severity and impact
2. Notify incident response team
3. Implement immediate fixes or rollback
4. Communicate status to stakeholders
5. Conduct post-incident review
